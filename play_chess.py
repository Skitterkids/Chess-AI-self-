""" play_chess.py
Authors: "Declan Cassidy, Milo Posada"

Makes a chessboard for the user to play on against a decision
based chess engine.

Currently, it uses engine_declan.py to represent the engine that you play against but this can be changed easily
by looking at the engine_move variable declaration in the game loop.

HOW TO USE:
To use your own engine with this, replace the 'from engine_declan.py import *' statement with your own engine's
file location. Then replace the 'engine_move = <function>' statement in the game loop with a function from your
file that returns a legal engine move.

TODO: Check if game state is checkmate or draw, so we can exit instead of program crashing
TODO: Allow the player to play as black
TODO: Come up with a more efficient solution for drawing the board after a move is made
      (currently it just draws over the last board lmao)
TODO: Click drag move is the only type that works right now, include other forms
TODO: Drag piece with mouse as you drag

TODO CAMILO: Redraw specific pieces when moves are made, make sure to take advantage of BoardSquare class
